# Playwright Python BDD Automation Framework

This project is a robust, data-driven automation framework built using **Playwright** for web interaction and the **Behave** framework for **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)**. It is designed for efficient, maintainable, and scalable test automation with integrated reporting, logging, and a user-friendly Streamlit interface for test management and execution.

---

## ✨ Features

* **BDD Approach:** Leverages the **Behave** framework for writing clear, executable specifications.
* **Centralized Locators:** All UI element locators (e.g., XPath, CSS Selectors) are externalized in a `config.ini` file for easy management and modification, accessed via `Readconfig.py`.
* **Page Object Model (POM):** Common methods for each application page are encapsulated in individual page object files within the `Feature` folder, promoting code reuse and maintainability.
* **Integrated Reporting:** Includes comprehensive **Allure Reporting** for detailed, interactive test results.
* **Database Integration:** A dedicated database file is created in the root directory to store all test **scenarios/tests** and their **historical results**, facilitating management via the Streamlit UI. **No sensitive data** is stored in this database.
* **Streamlit UI for Test Management:** Features a built-in web interface for viewing test history, selecting desired tests, executing them, and viewing updated results in a live grid.
* **Detailed Logging:** Scenario-specific logging is enabled for every test run, with log files named after the scenario, managed by `LogUtil.py`.
* **Video Recording:** Automatically captures a `.webm` video for every scenario run, stored in the `VideoReports` folder.
* **Trace Viewer Integration:** Stores a `trace.zip` file for deep debugging using Playwright's Trace Viewer.
* **Utility & Data Management:** Includes dedicated utility files and a database manager for common tasks and persistent test data storage.
* **Self-Sufficient Setup:** A single batch file (`start_project.bat`) handles virtual environment creation and dependency installation.

## 🚀 Getting Started

The project is designed to be self-sufficient. You only need a recent Python installation on your system.

### Prerequisites

1.  **Python:** Ensure you have the Python 3.13.0 installed.
2.  **SQLite:** This is Optional, to view the content of the dedicated database created for the project.

### Execution

1.  **Run the Starter Script:** Execute the main batch file from the project root:
    ```bash
    .\start_project.bat
    ```
2.  **Initial Setup (Automatic):** The `start_project.bat` script will automatically perform the following steps if needed:
    * Checks for and creates a **virtual environment**.
    * Installs all required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
    * Initializes the database using `DBManger.py` if it doesn't exist.
3.  **Launch Streamlit UI:** The script will then launch the Streamlit web application in your default browser.
4.  **Select & Run Tests:**
    * The UI displays all available tests and their historical results (fetched from the database).
    * User can select the test of choice.
    * Click the **Run selected tests** button to start the test run.
    * The results grid will update live upon completion.

## 🔒 Secure Configuration

All security-related points, user credentials, application routes, and environment URLs are read from a **`secrets.env`** file. This file **must** be created in the project root directory and is excluded from version control for security.

### `secrets.env` File Structure

Create a file named **`secrets.env`** in the root of the project and populate it with the required configuration:

BASE_URL=https://myproj.com/

BROWSER=my_desired_browser #chrome/firefox as of now

USERNAME=test_username

USER_EMAIL=test_useremail@test.com

PASSWORD=test_password

USER_DETAIL_API=https://myproj.com/api/test_api?email=

EXISTING_USER=test_existing_user

EXISTING_EMAIL=test_existing_user@yopmail.com
